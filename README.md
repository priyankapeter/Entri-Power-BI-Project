Financial Datasets
Insightful Analysis
This analysis of the financial dataset focuses on several key metrics, including sales, profit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and discount patterns across different products, countries, and segments. Below are the major insights identified during the analysis.
Total net sales report:
Bar Graph (Total Sales by Product):
This bar graph highlights the net sales performance of each product. Products are displayed on the X-axis, while their corresponding sum of the total sales are shown on the Y-axis. The graph allows for easy comparison of how different products contribute to total net sales.
Line bar graph (Total Sales and Profit by Country):
The Line bar graph displays the total sales and profit for each country.
The columns represent total sales, with each segment of the line showing the portion of profit.
Countries are listed on the X-axis, and total sales and profit values are shown on the Y-axis.
This chart allows users to easily compare both total sales and the profit contribution across different countries.
 Slicer (country):
A slicer is added to the dashboard, allowing users to filter the data by country.
Users can select one or multiple country to focus on sales and profit performance in specific time frames.
The slicer enhances interactivity by giving users control over the data displayed in the bar and line graphs.
Pie Chart (Total Sales by Segment):
The pie chart visualizes the total sales distributed across various business segments, such as government, smaill business, enterprise, midmarket, channel partners.
Each slice of the pie represents a segment, and the size of the slice corresponds to the proportion of total sales contributed by that segment.
The chart provides an at-a-glance comparison of how each segment contributes to the overall sales total.
Stacked Area Graph (Total Units Sold by Country and Segment):
The stacked area graph shows the units sold across different segments  over time or across countries.
The X-axis can represent countries, while the Y-axis represents the units sold.
Different colors are used to represent each segment, with areas stacked on top of one another to show the total units sold, as well as the contribution from each segment.
Map (Geographic Distribution of Units Sold by Country and Segment):
The map provides a geographical view of the units sold in each country and segment.
Countries are colored based on the volume of units sold and segment with darker shades representing higher numbers of units sold.
This map enables a quick overview of where the highest and lowest numbers of units sold are concentrated geographically.
Treemap Graph (Manufacturing Price and Sales Price by Product):
The treemap graph displays products as rectangles, with the size of each rectangle representing the manufacturing price and sales price of the product.
Larger rectangles indicate products with higher prices, while smaller ones represent products with lower prices.
Each product is assigned a different color, making it easy to visually distinguish between them.
The treemap helps to compare multiple products in terms of their manufacturing costs and sales prices within the same visual space.
Gauge Chart (Total Manufacturing Price and Total Sales Price):
The gauge chart represents the total or average manufacturing price and sales price against a defined range (for example, minimum, target, and maximum prices).
The needle indicates the current manufacturing price,sales price while the colored arc represents the range of manufacturing costs and sales costs (low, acceptable, high).
The chart includes thresholds for minimum, target, and maximum manufacturing price,sales price helping users quickly assess whether the manufacturing costs and sales costs are within acceptable limits.
Card (Total COGS, Total sales, Total discounts, Total profit):
This card displays the total COGS, total sales, total discounts, total profit for specific total number.
Slicer(Segment, Country, Product and Year):
This slicer allows users to select a specific segment, country, product and year to analyse.
Conclusion
The analysis provides a deep understanding of the sales and profit drivers across different segments, countries, and products. By optimizing discount strategies, targeting cost-efficiencies, and focusing on high-margin products, the company can improve both sales growth and profitability over time.
